## HUND Denmark

* This is a Product Hunt website. It includes user, moderator, and admin dashboards. When a user signs up or logs in using Google, all their data is stored in the database. If the user later logs in again with the same Gmail account, duplicate entries are avoided. The website is fully responsive and designed with a user-friendly UX for all devices. Using a new user token, members can access offers and subscriptions. For added security, JWT tokens have been implemented.
